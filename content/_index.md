# Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Cyven](https://www.cybertheye.com), my brain is overflowing with piece of shit right now, and I need a desktop where I can park and sort it all out.

So here it is. It's my braindump and also my 'desktop' littered with all kinds of concepts and learning fragments.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](braindump/posts/).

Have fun!
